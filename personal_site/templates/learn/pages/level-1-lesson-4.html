      <li>[triangles] Write a program called triangles.py that prompts the user for a number between 1 and 20. Print a triangle with a base that large. If the given number is larger than 20, ask again. For example:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="no-highlight">How big would you like the triangle to be? 25
  That's too big! Try again.
  How big would you like the triangle to be? 5

  ....
  .....

    <ul>
      <li>[guessing_game] Write a program called guessing_game.py that lets a user guess a random number. First, your program should ask the user what the maximum bounds should be. Next, tell the user you've thought of a number and ask for their first guess. Tell the user whether the number you're thinking of is higher or lower. Continue until the user correctly guesses the number, then tell them how many guesses it took. In case this is unclear, imagine the following game below:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="no-highlight">$ python3 guessing_game.py
  Welcome to the guessing game!
  What should the maximum number be? 100
  Okay, I've thought of a number between 1 and 100!  (Imagine the computer randomly got 56 here)
  What's your guess? 50
  Nope! My number is higher.
  What's your guess? 70
  Nope! My number is lower.
  What's your guess? 60
  Nope! My number is lower.
  What's your guess? 55
  Nope! My number is higher.
  What's your guess? 56
  You got it!
  You took 5 guesses to find my number. Not bad!
