<p><strong>Before the lecture, please read the following chapters:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 7: Iteration</li>
  <li>Chapter 8: Strings</li>
  <li>Chapter 10: Lists</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>
<p>Question 1: What will be printed after running the following program?</p>
<pre><code class="python">total = 0
for num in range(5):
  total += num
  print(total) </code></pre>

{{
  learn_pages_utils.render_question_responses(1, [
    (True, "10", "Correct!"),
    (False, "15", "Incorrect. Remember that range starts from 0 and goes <em>up to</em> the final number"),
    (False, "01234", "Incorrect. We're summing numbers, not concatenating strings"),
    (False, "012345", "Incorrect. We're summing numbers, not concatenating strings"),
  ])
}}

<p>Question 2: What will be printed after running the following program?</p>
<pre><code class="python">result = 0
my_list = [1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 1, 1]
index = 0
while my_list[index] != 7:
  result += my_list[index]

print(result) </code></pre>

{{
  learn_pages_utils.render_question_responses(2, [
    (False, "11", "Incorrect. You probably had the right idea, but pay attention to the value of index at each iteration of the loop"),
    (False, "18", "Incorrect. If you picked this, it's important to remember that when the while condition fails, we immediately exit the loop"),
    (False, "21", "Incorrect. Remember the condition to exit the loop!"),
    (True, "<em>(nothing)</em>", "Correct! We never advance <code>index</code> so we have a logical error in our code"),
  ])
}}

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From section <strong>7.9</strong>, do exercises <strong>7.1</strong> and <strong>7.2</strong></li>
  <li>From section <strong>8.13</strong>, do exercises <strong>8.1</strong> to <strong>8.4</strong></li>
  <li>From section <strong>10.15</strong>, do exercises <strong>10.1</strong> to <strong>10.6</strong></li>
  <li>[triangles] Write a program called triangles.py that prompts the user for a number between 1 and 20. Print a triangle with a base that large. If the given number is larger than 20, ask again. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">How big would you like the triangle to be? 25
That's too big! Try again.
How big would you like the triangle to be? 5
.
..
...
....
.....  </code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>[guessing_game] Write a program called guessing_game.py that lets a user guess a random number. First, your program should ask the user what the maximum bounds should be. Next, tell the user you've thought of a number and ask for their first guess. Tell the user whether the number you're thinking of is higher or lower. Continue until the user correctly guesses the number, then tell them how many guesses it took. In case this is unclear, imagine the following game below:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">$ python3 guessing_game.py
Welcome to the guessing game!
What should the maximum number be? 100
Okay, I've thought of a number between 1 and 100!  (Imagine the computer randomly got 56 here)
What's your guess? 50
Nope! My number is higher.
What's your guess? 70
Nope! My number is lower.
What's your guess? 60
Nope! My number is lower.
What's your guess? 55
Nope! My number is higher.
What's your guess? 56
You got it!
You took 5 guesses to find my number. Not bad!  </code></pre>
