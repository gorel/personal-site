  <h1 id="back-to-top">Introduction</h1>
  <p>Ever wanted to learn to program but not sure where to begin? This class will help guide you through some topics you might learn about in a first semester CS course. You should have completed the lessons from Programming Beginners Level 1 or have prior experience with basic programming concepts such as strings, integers, arrays, for loops, and while loops.</p>

  <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
  <p>At a minimum, you should install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> and a text editor. If you're using a mac, there's a good chance you have these by default. Open a terminal (search for Terminal in finder) and type python3. If you don't get an error message, you have Python 3! For a text editor, I personally enjoy Atom, but there are many different options.</p>
  <p>If you're on Windows, you will likely have to install these yourself. Check out the link above to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> and for a text editor, I highly recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, but again, there are many viable options.</p>
  <p>For more information on setting up your development environment, please see the setup instructions from <a href="level-1-foreword.html">the level 1 class</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
  <p>We will loosely follow the textbook "Think Python - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"</p>
  <p>This is a different book than has commonly been taught in the level 1 class, so it may teach you some concepts in different ways that make more sense.</p>
  <p>It is available for free online:<br />
