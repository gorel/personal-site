        It is recommended that you go through the pandas tutorial (available <a href="special-topics-pandas.html">here</a> if you haven't yet. This lesson builds upon many of the ideas first introduced there. Pandas and matplotlib go together closely, but understanding pandas first will make some concepts in this tutorial more clear.

  <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
  <p>Before beginning this lesson, you will need to install and set up Jupyter notebook. Instructions for this are listed here, though they may vary slightly between systems.</p>

  <p>To begin, open a terminal and run the following commands (<code>$</code> represents the terminal prompt)</p>

  <pre><code class="bash">$ pip3 install --user numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
( you'll see lots of install messages here )
$ jupyter-notebook
( a new window should open in your browser like http://localhost:8888/tree )</code></pre>

  <p>In the top right of the web page that opened, click New &rarr; Python3 notebook. Type the following in the first cell of the notebook:</p>

  <pre><code class="python">import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Success!")</code></pre>

  <p>Hit the Run button in the toolbar. If you didn't get an error, great! You're all set for class. If you <em>did</em> get an error, send it to me, and I'll help you debug what's going wrong.</p>

  <p>From here, you're ready to go through the interactive tutorial below. You may wish to play around in Jupyter first to get accustomed to how it works. It's extremely powerful and there are many features you may enjoy.</p>

  <h2 id="start-here">The interactive tutorial</h2>
  <p>The tutorial for matplotlib is completely interactive! To go through the tutorial, first download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m7qfx5npov5z2uo/winequality.csv?dl=0">this csv file</a> which will be the input dataset, then download the iPython notebook <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mx31wr8ul418xtn/Matplotlib%20Tutorial.ipynb?dl=0">here</a>.
